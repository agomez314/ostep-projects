# My OSTEP projects
This is a collection of programs that attempt to solve the projects in "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces" Book/course. There are programs that try to replicate shell utilities, a shell interpreter and threaded programs. 

Each folder is a different project with testfiles, instructions, and the program itself. Some have multiple header files. Running them is as simple as doing 

```
gcc -o main main.c -Wall -Werror
```

Future work is to add a Makefile that will make compilation easier to manage.
